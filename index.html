<p>Mostly PowerShell related Freeware and Open Source stuff will be published here.</p>

<p>A while ago we decided to publish some of our wok as Freeware under the terms of the BSD License (Cause it is very flexible for all of us).
This Repository contains the stuff that we think it's useful for the community.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why-free" class="anchor" href="#why-free" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Free?</h3>

<p>That is very easy to answer: Cause we think that the community might find the stuff useful!</p>

<p>And why should charge for everything? Our focus is to optimize customer businesses by helping them to automate as much as possible.</p>

<p>But we need to automate our own stuff to. Most of the thing we will publish here is that kind of stuff that we invented, adopted or developed to run our or automate our own processes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="support" class="anchor" href="#support" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support?</h3>

<p>Yes, there is support! But the support is based on best effort.</p>
