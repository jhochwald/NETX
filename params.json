Our focus is to optimize customer businesses by helping them to automate as much as possible.\r\n\r\nBut we need to automate our own stuff to. Most of the thing we will publish here is that kind of stuff that we invented, adopted or developed to run our or automate our own processes.\r\n\r\n### Support?\r\nYes, there is support! But the support is based on best effort.\r\n\r\nFeel free to Open an [Issue](https://github.com/jhochwald/NETX/issues) here.\r\n\r\n### Feedback?\r\nFeedback is more then welcome! Feel free to Open an [Issue](https://github.com/jhochwald/NETX/issues) here.\r\n\r\n### Contributing?\r\nIf you find a problem or Bug, just let me know.
