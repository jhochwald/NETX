**NET-Experts Free-ware and Open Source**

Mostly PowerShell related **Freeware** and **Open Source** stuff is published here.

A while ago we decided to publish some of our stuff as **Open Source** under the terms of the BSD License (Cause it is very flexible for all of us).

*This Repository contains the stuff that we think it's useful for the community.*

## General Repository Information
The branching structure follows the git flow concept, defined by [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

#### Master branch
The main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.

#### Develop branch
Consider this to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Some would call this the "integration branch".

#### Feature branches
These are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).

#### Release branches
These branches support preparation of a new production release. By using this, the develop branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release.

#### Hotfix branches
Hotfix branches are very much like release branches in that they are also meant to prepare for a new production release, albeit unplanned.

We use git-flow functions whenever possible to build patches, fixes or releases! That increases the number of branches, but it makes the tracking much easier and it is easier for us.

<a name="trademarks"></a>
## Trademarks
Many (or nearly all) names of products and companies mentioned here are registered trademarks or trademarks of others.

<a name="reservation-of-rights"></a>
## Reservation of Rights
Many parts, functions or source code fragments are based on the intellectual work, scripts and sources of others. Even if the source might not be a copy or direct clone, the function or even the idea might be inspired by the work of others. We deeply respect and acknowledge the intellectual work of others! Due to the nature of underlying scripting technology it’s hard and nearly impossible to track where ideas or even inspirations originally came from!

Whenever it is possible to track the source or idea or find out where it comes from, we will put the author, copyright and license (if exist) to the script.
