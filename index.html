<p>Mostly PowerShell related Freeware and Open Source stuff will be published here.</p>

<p>A while ago we decided to publish some of our wok as Freeware under the terms of the BSD License (Cause it is very flexible for all of us).
This Repository contains the stuff that we think it's useful for the community.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-free" class="anchor" href="#why-free" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Free?</h2>

<p>That is very easy to answer: Cause we think that the community might find the stuff useful!</p>

<p>And why should charge for everything? Our focus is to optimize customer businesses by helping them to automate as much as possible.</p>

<p>But we need to automate our own stuff to. Most of the thing we will publish here is that kind of stuff that we invented, adopted or developed to run our or automate our own processes.</p>

<h2>
<a id="support" class="anchor" href="#support" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Support?</h2>

<p>Yes, there is support! But the support is based on best effort.</p>

<p>Feel free to Open an <a href="https://github.com/jhochwald/NETX/issues">Issue</a> here.</p>

<p><em>There is no entitlement, claim, or right to get a request, problem or even a bug that is reported fixed or solved!</em></p>

<h2>
<a id="general-repository-information" class="anchor" href="#general-repository-information" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General Repository Information</h2>

<p>The branching structure follows the git flow concept, defined by <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">Vincent Driessen</a></p>

<h4>
<a id="master-branch" class="anchor" href="#master-branch" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Master branch</h4>

<p>The main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.</p>

<h4>
<a id="develop-branch" class="anchor" href="#develop-branch" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Develop branch</h4>

<p>Consider this to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Some would call this the "integration branch".</p>

<h4>
<a id="feature-branches" class="anchor" href="#feature-branches" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Feature branches</h4>

<p>These are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).</p>

<h4>
<a id="release-branches" class="anchor" href="#release-branches" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Release branches</h4>

<p>These branches support preparation of a new production release. By using this, the develop branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release.</p>

<h4>
<a id="hotfix-branches" class="anchor" href="#hotfix-branches" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hotfix branches</h4>

<p>Hotfix branches are very much like release branches in that they are also meant to prepare for a new production release, albeit unplanned.</p>

<p>We use git-flow functions whenever possible to build patches, fixes or releases! That increases the number of branches, but it makes the tracking much easier and it is easier for us.</p>

<h2>
<a id="trademarks" class="anchor" href="#trademarks" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Trademarks</h2>

<p>Many (or nearly all) names of products and companies mentioned here are registered trademarks or trademarks of others.</p>

<h2>
<a id="reservation-of-rights" class="anchor" href="#reservation-of-rights" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reservation of Rights</h2>

<p>Many parts, functions or source code fragments are based on the intellectual work, scripts and sources of others. Even if the source might not be a copy or direct clone, the function or even the idea might be inspired by the work of others. We deeply respect and acknowledge the intellectual work of others! Due to the nature of underlying scripting technology itâ€™s hard and nearly impossible to track where ideas or even inspirations originally came from!</p>

<p>Whenever it is possible to track the source or idea or find out where it comes from, we will put the author, copyright and license (if exist) to the script.</p>
