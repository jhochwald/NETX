Our focus is to optimize customer businesses by helping them to automate as much as possible.\r\n\r\nBut we need to automate our own stuff to. Most of the thing we will publish here is that kind of stuff that we invented, adopted or developed to run our or automate our own processes.\r\n\r\n## Why Open Source\r\nThat is very easy to answer: Cause we think that the community might find some of our stuff useful!\r\n\r\nThe more people have the code, the more they learn PowerShell!\r\n\r\n## Support?\r\nYes, there is support! But the support is based on best effort.\r\n\r\nFeel free to Open an [Issue](https://github.com/jhochwald/NETX/issues) here.\r\n\r\n*There is no entitlement, claim, or right to get a request, problem or even a bug that is reported fixed or solved!*\r\n\r\n## Feedback?\r\nFeedback is more then welcome!

We understand a truly effective security as a system that is followed by every employee, affiliate and Partner. We deeply respect our customer’s intellectual property rights and business data and take comprehensive measures to safeguard them. A whole range of security procedures and policies are established at different levels.\r\n\r\nThe remote access to customer data and systems is restricted to the authorized personnel only. Every Remote Access via [NET-Experts](http://net-experts.net/) are logged, tracked and monitored.\r\n\r\n## General Repository Information\r\nThe branching structure follows the git flow concept, defined by [Vincent Driessen](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)\r\n\r\n#### Master branch\r\nThe main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.\r\n\r\n#### Develop branch\r\nConsider this to be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Some would call this the \"integration branch\".\r\n\r\n#### Feature branches\r\nThese are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release. The essence of a feature branch is that it exists as long as the feature is in development, but will eventually be merged back into develop (to definitely add the new feature to the upcoming release) or discarded (in case of a disappointing experiment).\r\n\r\n#### Release branches\r\nThese branches support preparation of a new production release. By using this, the develop branch is cleared to receive features for the next big release.\r\n\r\n#### Hotfix branches\r\nHotfix branches are very much like release branches in that they are also meant to prepare for a new production release, albeit unplanned.\r\n\r\nWe use git-flow functions whenever possible to build patches, fixes or releases! That increases the number of branches, but it makes the tracking much easier and it is easier for us.\r\n\r\n## Trademarks\r\nMany (or nearly all) names of products and companies mentioned here are registered trademarks or trademarks of others.\r\n\r\n## Reservation of Rights\r\nMany parts, functions or source code fragments are based on the intellectual work, scripts and sources of others. Even if the source might not be a copy or direct clone, the function or even the idea might be inspired by the work of others. We deeply respect and acknowledge the intellectual work of others! Due to the nature of underlying scripting technology it’s hard and nearly impossible to track where ideas or even inspirations originally came from!\r\n\r\nWhenever it is possible to track the source or idea or find out where it comes from, we will put the author, copyright and license (if exist) to the script.\r\n",
